This was the first project where I fully implemented my css grid skills. The site's layout was screaming "GRID" and I just couldn't look the other way. Even though it seemed pretty straightforward at first glance, it took me a while before I could evenly space out the last two columns and ensure the uniformity in the dimensions of each box in the grid. While writing my css, I also realized that styling navbars isn't actually that pesky like I previously imagined. In hindsight, this was a fairly simple yet fundamental project in reinforcing my basic grid concepts.
